# Complete the 'powerSum' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. INTEGER X
#  2. INTEGER N

# 3 key steps for recursion
# 1. Must have at least ONE base case
# 2. Must have a recursive case
# 3. Make sure the recursive case can be eventually reduced to base case
