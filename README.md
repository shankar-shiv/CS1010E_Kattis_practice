### Leetcode Grind 75 by NUS CS senior Tay Yangshun :) 
HackerRank Practice Java, C++, Algorithms

### FAQ:
- What are some useful features of java that you are allowed to use in CS2040s?
  - ArrayList(better than standard arrays), LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashMap, HashSet that's about it I think
  - You will be implementing most of the data structures yourself
  - most of the linear data structures are available in java.util

Linear Data Structures: 
- Arrays
- Lists (ArrayList/LinkedList)
- Stack (Stack)
- Queue (use the LinkedList class - O(1) enqueue and dequeue time)
- Map (Either HashMap/HashSet)

Nonlinear Data Structures: 
- Binary Heap (PriorityQueue)
- PriorityQueue (PriorityQueue)
- UFDS (implement your own)
- Tree (implement your own - typically has to be a balancing one), 
- Graphs (can represent them using Arrays for adjMatrix, List<List<T>> for adjList and List<Triple<T>> for edgeList)
- TreeMap and TreeSet available but don't really need to use as much. (These are lifesavers for where you need map ordered by keys)

I think this covers 2040S DS portion
For Algorithms I remember:

Linear:
- Hashing Algorithm (just a brief overview)

Non-linear (Primarily for Graphs and Trees):

Traversal:
- Breadth First Search [BFS]
- Depth First Search + variations (inorder/preorder/postorder) [DFS]

MST:
- Prim's
- Kruskal's

Strongly Connected Components:
- Kosaraju's

Single Source Shortest Path:
- Bellman-Ford
- Dijkstra (modified and non-modified)
- BFS

All Pairs Shortest Path:
- Floyd-Warshall
- Dijkstra from every node
